# Aneural Consciousness 
[HOME](https://autognorics.github.io/) 

In the previous articles, Lawsin claimed that being alive and being aware are two different things. To be alive, according to him, means to be able to self-consume energy, e.g. a battery-operated toy is alive as long as it consumes energy by itself. While to be aware means to be able to sense signals through intuitive objects (IOs) or Exyzforms. 

In this article, the third order of Life, called Consciousness is examined based on Codexation, a study about abstract (subject) and physical (object) information. In this study, one of its findings, known as the Codexation Dilemma, reveals an unprecedented insight that determines consciousness. This key factor of consciousness uncovered that "No human can think of something without matching or associating such abstract thought with something physical." In other words, for a machine to be considered conscious, it has the self-ability to associate a subject with an object.  

For example, if I introduce to my readers a word unfamiliar to them,  there is a 100% chance that no one here can give a direct accurate explanation of what this word is. The reason behind this is simple. The unfamiliar word is not yet in one's own vocabulary and thus no physical construct stored yet in one's mind. This predicament, when defined, makes one conscious even without the need of the brain!

In the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoYvR7LgpU4&feature=emb_title), the machine was tested for consciousness. Instead of using the old fashion analog switches, the biotronic was subjected using digital switches implemented by the Arduino environment. Its built-in digital switches inside its microprocessor were switched on and off digitally through a program called Sketch. This program executes the basic commands of edge means danger while the center of the table means safe. When the whole inscription process was mechanically etched, structurally designed, and mathematically formed as Natural Intuitive Objects (NIO), like the eyes for seeing or ears for hearing, the input-output sensor will function as a device for consciousness. The ability of a machine to match or pair is a telltale sign of Associative Consciousness.

The biotronic in the video is alive, aware, and conscious, but not living and with life yet. However, on the next video, the machine will be trained to be rational or intuitive.
